1. What modifier is used to mark an annotation element as optional?
    A. optional
    B. default
    C. required
    D. value
    E. case
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    B. The default modifier along with a value is used to mark an annotation element as optional, as opposed to required.

2. Given a Broadway show, which information is best stored using annotations? (Choose two.)
    A. The number of people attending each day
    B. The maximum number of tickets a person can purchase
    C. The total number of people the theater can hold
    D. The price including discounts a person pays for a ticket
    E. A person’s seat assignment
    F. The time a ticket is sold

    Explanation :
    B,C. Annotations are about storing metadata, or data about data. The maximum number of tickets per person and total number of people the theater can hold define rules that are unlikely to change frequently, so they are best stored with annotations. The number of people attending,price, and time the ticket is sold are likely to change frequently and should be part of the transactional information for the ticket. The seat assignment also changes for every ticket sold.

3. Fill in the blank with the correct annotation usage that allows the code to compile.
    public interface CelestialBody {
        String name();
        double size() default 100;
        int lightYears = 2;
    }
    _________________ class Planet {}

    A. @CelestialBody(name="Venus")
    B. @CelestialBody(name="Pluto", size=2, lightYears=5)
    C. @CelestialBody(lightYears=10)
    D. @CelestialBody("Jupiter")
    E. @CelestialBody(size=3)
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    F. CelestialBody is not an annotation definition because it is not declared with the @interface type, making option F correct. If the correct declaration was used, then option A would be the correct answer. Options B and C are incorrect, because lightYears is a constant and cannot be set as part of the annotation. Options C and E are also incorrect because they are missing a name element. Option D is incorrect because there is no value() element.

4. Fill in the blank with the correct value for @Target that allows the code to compile.
    import java.lang.annotation.*;

    @Target({____________________})
    public @interface LightSource {}

    @LightSource class Bulb {
        @LightSource void lightSwitch() {}
        @LightSource private Bulb() {}
    }

    A. ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR
    B. ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE
    C. ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR, ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD
    D. ElementType.TYPE_USE
    E. ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE, ElementType.FIELD
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    C. Option C uses the correct values and allows all three annotations to compile. Option A is 
    incorrect because the class declaration usage does not compile. Using option B or E does not 
    allow any of the annotations to compile. Option D allows the class and constructor annotations to compile, but not the method usage

5. Which of the following are marker annotations? (Choose three.)

    A. @Target
    B. @Inherited
    C. @Override
    D. @Retention
    E. @Repeatable
    F. @Documented

    Explanation :
    B,C,F. Options B, C, and F are each marker annotations because they do not contain any elements. 
    Option A is incorrect because @Target requires an ElementType[] value. 
    Option D is incorrect because @Retention requires a RetentionPolicy value. 
    Option E is incorrect because @Repeatable requires a Class value.

6. Given the following declarations, which annotations can fill in the blank that would allow the code to compile? (Choose three.)
    public @interface Music {
        String value() default "violin";
    }
    class Orchestra {
        ______________ void play() {}
    }

    A. @Music(super="piccolo")
    B. @Music("viola")
    C. @Music(value()="bass")
    D. @Music
    E. @Music(default="flute")
    F. @Music(value="cello")

    Explanation :
    B,D,F. Option B is correct and relies on the fact that the single element value() can be 
    used without an element name. 
    Option D is correct because the annotation has a default value; therefore, value is optional. 
    Option F is correct and uses the correct name for value. 
    Options A, C, and E are incorrect because they use the wrong name for the element.

7. How many lines of the following declaration contain a compiler error?
    1: public @interface Thermometer {
    2:      int minTemp();
    3:      Integer maxTemp() default 1;
    4:      double[] color();
    5:      final String type;
    6:      Boolean compact;
    7: }

    A. None
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. Three
    E. Four
    F. Five

    Explanation :
    D. Lines 3 and 6 do not compile because wrapper classes are not permitted as annotation element types. 
    Line 5 does not compile because a constant must be declared with a value. 
    For these reasons, option D is correct. The rest of the lines compile without issue.

8. In what ways are annotations similar to interfaces? (Choose two.)
    A. They can both declare methods with bodies.
    B. They can both declare constructors.
    C. They can both declare constants.
    D. They can both be extended with the extends keyword.
    E. They can both be used in a class declaration.
    F. They both are declared with the interface type.

    Explanation :
    C,E. Annotations and interfaces can both declare constants and be applied to a class declaration, making options C and E correct. 
    Options A and D are incorrect. An interface can define a method and be extended, but an annotation cannot. 
    Neither type can declare constructors, making option B incorrect. 
    Interfaces use the interface type, while annotations use the @interface type, making option F incorrect

9. In how many of the marked places (m1, m2, m3) will adding the line
    @SuppressWarnings() independently allow the class to compile without any warnings?
    import java.util.*;
    // m1
    public class Space {
        // m2
        final void frontier() {
            List<Object> stars = List.of(1,2,3);
            stars.add(4);
            // m3
            List planets = new ArrayList<>();
            planets.add(5);
        }
    }

    A. None, the class does not compile as is.
    B. None, the class already compiles without warnings.
    C. One.
    D. Two.
    E. Three.
    F. None of the above.

    Explanation :
    F. The class compiles as is but generates warnings for unchecked/unsafe operations with the planets.add(5) operation, so options A and B are incorrect. 
    Inserting @SuppressWarnings(), though, will cause a compiler error as it requires at least one value. For this reason, option F is correct. 
    If @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") was used instead, then inserting it on lines m1 and m2 would allow the code to compile without any warnings.

10. An annotation cannot be applied to which of the following?
    A. Class declaration.
    B. Annotation declaration.
    C. Inner class declaration.
    D. Cast operation.
    E. Local variable declaration using var.
    F. An annotation can be applied to all of the above.

    Explanation :
    F. An annotation can be applied to all of these Java declarations, making option F correct

11. Which statements about the @Override annotation are correct? (Choose three.)
    A. It can be optionally specified when a class implements an abstract interface method.
    B. Adding it to a method may trigger a compiler error.
    C. It is required whenever a class implements an abstract interface method.
    D. It can be added to an interface declaration type.
    E. It can be optionally specified when a method is overridden in a subclass.
    F. It is required whenever a method is overridden in a subclass.

    Explanation :
    A,B,E. The @Override annotation is always optional for methods and never required. For this reason, options A and E are correct, 
    and options C and F are incorrect. 
    Option B is correct because adding it to a method that is not actually overriding an inherited method will cause a compiler error. 
    Option D is incorrect because it can be applied only to method declarations.

12. Given the following declarations, which annotation can be applied to a method declaration?
    import java.lang.annotation.*;
    @interface Bread {
        public int maker = 5;
        String baker();
    }
    @Inherited
    @interface Toast {
        boolean buttered() default true;
        int freshness() default Bread.maker;
        static boolean wheat = false;
    }
    A. @Toast(true)
    B. @Toast
    C. @Bread("null")
    D. @Toast(wheat=true)
    E. @Bread
    F. None of the above, as the annotation declarations do not compile

    Explanation :
    B. The declaration compiles, so option F is incorrect. 
    The Bread annotation is declared with one required element, while Toast is declared with no required elements. For these reasons, option B is correct, and option E is incorrect. 
    Options A and C are incorrect because neither annotation contains a value() element. 
    Option D is incorrect because wheat is a constant, not an element.

13. Which properties of the Clean annotation must be true for the following to compile? (Choose three.)
    @Clean("Basement") public class House {}
    A. The annotation must contain exactly one element.
    B. The annotation must contain an element named value.
    C. The element must not have a default value.
    D. The element may have a default value.
    E. The annotation may contain more than one element.
    F. The annotation must contain an element named values.

    Explanation :
    B,D,E. An annotation may omit the element name if it contains an element named value, declared as value(), making option B correct and option F incorrect. 
    Additionally, it may contain any number of additional elements, provided none of them is required, making option E correct. 
    Finally, the element may optionally have a default value, making option D correct. 
    The other options are incorrect statements that contradict the correct answers.

14. Assume the following code compiles. Which annotation inserted in the line allows the code to
    print a non-null value at runtime?
    // INSERT HERE
    @interface Fast {
        int topSpeed() default 10;
    }
    @Fast class BigCat {}
    public class Cheetah extends BigCat {
        public static void main(String... unused) {
            var a = Cheetah.class.getAnnotation(Fast.class);
            System.out.print(a);
        }
    }
    A. @Inherited
    B. @Polymorphism
    C. @Inheritance
    D. @Retention
    E. @Subclass
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    F. Trick question! By default, annotations are not present at runtime. 
    To print a non-null value, both @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) and @Inherited would be required, making option F correct. 
    The @Retention annotation would preserve the annotation for runtime, while the @Inherited annotation would apply it to the subclass Cheetah.

15. How many lines of the following declaration contain a compiler error?
    1: public @interface Student {
    2:      final boolean likesPonies = true;
    3:      int value default 100;
    4:      int age();
    5:      /** TODO **/
    6:      String name() default "Olivia";
    7: }

    A. None
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. Three
    E. Four
    F. Five

    Explanation :
    B. Only line 3 contains a compiler error, as an element declared in an annotation must use parentheses after its name, making option B correct. 
    If value() was used instead of value, then the code would compile

16. Which statement about the following declarations is correct?
    import java.lang.annotation.*;
    import java.util.List;

    @Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)
    public @interface Friend {
        String value();
        String lastName() default null;
        int age = 10;
    }
    class MyFriends {
        void makeFriends() {
            var friends = List.of(new @Friend("Olivia") Object(),
                new @Friend("Adeline") String(),
                new @Friend("Henry") MyFriends());
        }
    }

    A. None of the declarations compile.
    B. Only the declaration of Friend contains a compiler error.
    C. Only the declaration of MyFriends contains a compiler error.
    D. Both declarations contain compiler errors.
    E. None of the above.

    Explanation :
    B. A default annotation element value must be a non-null constant expression. Since lastName() provides a null value by default, the declaration of Friend contains a compiler error. 
    The declaration of MyFriends does not contain any compiler errors, so option B is correct.

17. Which of the following are permitted to be used for annotation element type? (Choose three.)
    A. Object
    B. An annotation
    C. Class[]
    D. An enum
    E. Double
    F. var

    Explanation :
    B,C,D. An annotation element type must be a primitive type, a String, a Class, an enum, another annotation, or an array of any of these types. For this reason, options B, C, and D are correct. 
    Option A is incorrect because Object is not supported. 
    While primitives are supported, wrappers are not, making option E incorrect. 
    Option F is also incorrect as local variable type inference with var is not permitted, even if a default value is provided.

18. Fill in the blanks with the lines of code that allow the program to compile. (Choose two.)
    import java.lang.annotation.*;
    @Repeatable(___________) // t1
    @interface Gift {
        String value();
    }
    @interface Presents {
        ___________; // t2
    }
    @Gift("Book") @Gift("Toy") public class Surprise {}

    A. Presents on line t1
    B. @Presents on line t1
    C. Gift value() on line t2
    D. Presents.class on line t1
    E. Gift[] value() on line t2
    F. Gift[] gift() on line t2

    Explanation :
    D,E. Gift is a repeatable annotation. It requires specifying a container type annotation using the Class object, making option D correct. 
    The containing type annotation referenced must declare a value() element that is an array of the repeatable annotation, making option E correct.

19. Which statements about annotations are correct? (Choose three.)
    A. Annotations contain data that changes throughout the program execution.
    B. Adding an annotation to a class that already compiles may trigger a compiler error and cause it to fail to compile.
    C. Annotations contain metadata about a Java type.
    D. Annotations cannot be applied to lambda expression variables.
    E. Annotations cannot be applied to other annotations.
    F. Removing all annotations from a class that already compiles will not introduce a compiler error.

    Explanation :
    B,C,F. Option A is incorrect, as annotations generally contain information that is constant throughout the program execution. 
    Option B is correct. For example, adding an @Override annotation to a method that is not a valid override will trigger a compiler error. 
    Option C is also correct and is the primary purpose of annotations. 
    Options D and E are incorrect, as annotations can be applied to a variety of types including lambda expression variables and other annotations. 
    Finally, option F is correct. Annotations are optional metadata, and removing all of them from a class does not cause a compiler error

20. Given the following declarations, which annotations can fill in the blank that would allow
    the code to compile? (Choose three.)
    import java.util.*;
    public @interface Vacuum {
    String[] value();
    }
    class Appliance {
    ______________ void clean() {}
    }
    A. @Vacuum({})
    B. @Vacuum({"upright","new"})
    C. @Vacuum(List.of("portable"))
    D. @Vacuum
    E. @Vacuum("handheld")
    F. @Vacuum(default="shop")

    Explanation :
    A,B,E. Options A, B, and E are correct and rely on the fact that the element name is optional for an annotation with a single element named value(). 
    Option E also relies on annotations supporting a single element for an array. Note that the array provided is not required to have any elements. 
    Option C is incorrect because Java does not automatically convert from a List to an array. 
    Option D is incorrect because the annotation contains a required element. 
    Finally, option F is incorrect because default is the wrong element name
    
21. Which method declarations can @SafeVarargs be correctly applied to? (Choose two.)
    A. protected void hum(double... tune)
    B. final int whistle(int length, float... measure) 
    C. static void sing()
    D. private void listen(String... mp3)
    E. void dance(List<Integer>... beat)
    F. private static int play(int[] notes)

    Explanation :
    B,D. The @SafeVarargs annotation requires the method to which it is applied contain a varargs parameter and be unable to be overridden, aka marked static, final, or private. Options B and D fulfill this requirement. 
    Options A and E are missing a modifier that prevents them from being overridden. 
    Options C and F are missing a vararg parameter. While a primitive array int[] can be passed to a method containing a varargs parameter, to apply the @SafeVarargs annotation, the method must be declared with a varargs annotation.

22. Which annotation can be applied to an existing annotation X and ensures a class that uses X shows the annotation in its generated Javadoc?
    A. @Documented
    B. @Generated
    C. @JavaDoc
    D. @PreserveAnnotations
    E. @Retention
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    A. The correct annotation that preserves information about annotations in generated Javadoc files is @Documented. The rest are incorrect

23. Fill in the blank with the value that allows the annotation to be accessible by the JVM in which it is executed?
    import java.lang.annotation.*;
    @Retention(__________________)
    public class Corn {}
    A. RetentionPolicy.CLASS
    B. RetentionPolicy.JRE
    C. RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME
    D. RetentionPolicy.SOURCE
    E. RetentionPolicy.LIVE
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    F. The @Retention annotation can be applied only to an annotation declaration, not a class declaration, making option F the correct answer. 
    Applying it to a class will result in a compiler error. If Corn were an annotation, though, then RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME would be correct

24. How many lines of the following declarations contain a compiler error?
    1: @interface Sword {}
    2: public @interface Zelda {
    3:      private String game();
    4:      Sword sword();
    5:      java.util.List<Integer> gems;
    6:      final boolean hasBossKey();
    7:      public abstract int level() default 99;
    8:      protected boolean continue();
    9: }
    A. None
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. Three
    E. Four
    F. Five

    Explanation :
    E. Lines 3 and 8 do not compile because annotation elements must be public, implicitly or explicitly. 
    Line 8 also does not compile because continue is a keyword in Java. 
    Line 5 does not compile. While arrays are permitted as element types, collections like List are not. 
    Line 6 does not compile because annotation elements cannot be marked final, as they are implicitly abstract. For these reasons, option E is correct. 
    Line 4 compiles because an annotation can declare another annotation as the element type. 
    Line 7 also compiles. While the public and abstract modifiers aren’t required for an annotation element, they can be specified.

25. Which of the following are permitted for an annotation element default value? (Choose three.)
    A. ""
    B. (int)1_000.0
    C. new String()
    D. Integer.valueOf(3).intValue()
    E. null
    F. Integer.MAX_VALUE

    Explanation :
     A,B,F. An annotation element can include a default value if it is a non-null constant expression. Options A, B, and F fulfill this criteria. 
     Option C is incorrect because it creates a new object. 
     Option D is incorrect because it uses method calls. 
     Option E is incorrect because null is not permitted.

26. Assuming @Weather is a valid repeatable annotation that takes a String, with its associated containing type annotation @Forecast, which of the following can be applied to a type declaration? (Choose two.)
    A. @Forecast({"Storm", "Cloudy"})
    B. @Forecast({@Weather("Storm"), @Weather("Cloudy")})
    C. @Weather("Storm") @Weather("Cloudy")
    D. @Weather({@Forecast("Storm"), @Forecast("Cloudy")})
    E. @Forecast("Storm") @Forecast("Cloudy")
    F. @Weather({"Storm", "Cloudy"})

    Explanation :
    B,C. @Weather is the repeatable annotation, so it can be used twice on the same type declaration, making option C correct. 
    A containing type annotation @Forecast takes an array of the repeatable annotation @Weather, making option B also correct. 
    Options A and F are incorrect, as those represent an annotation that takes an array of String values. 
    Option D and E are incorrect because the repeatable and containing type annotations are reversed.

27. Which of the following interface declarations will still compile if @FunctionalInterface is applied to each? (Choose two.)
    interface Dog {
        default void drink() {}
        void play();
    }
    interface Astra extends Dog {
        private static int eat() { return 1; }
        void fetch();
    }
    interface Webby extends Dog {
        abstract void play();
        default void rest() {}
        abstract String toString();
    }
    interface KC {}
    interface Georgette extends Dog {
        int intelligence = 5;
        void jump();
    }

    A. Dog
    B. KC
    C. Georgette
    D. Webby
    E. Astra

    Explanation :
    A,D. To correctly apply the @FunctionalInterface annotation, the interface must pass the single abstract method test. 
    Also, note that none of the default or static methods contributes to the abstract method count.
    Dog contains a single abstract method play(), so it will compile, making option A correct. 
    Webby extends Dog with the same abstract method as Dog. It also declares toString(), but since this is inherited from java.lang.Object, it does not count as an abstract 
    method. Therefore, Webby passes the single abstract method test for functional interfaces, making option D correct. 
    Astra is incorrect because it contains two abstract methods, play() and fetch(). 
    KC is incorrect because it does not extend Dog and does not contain any abstract methods. 
    Finally, Georgette is incorrect because it contains two abstract methods, play() and jump().

28. How many lines of the following declarations contain a compiler error?
    import java.lang.annotation.*;

    enum Colors { RED, BLUE, GREEN }
    @Documented
    public @interface Bouncy {
        int value();
        Colors color() default Colors.RED;
        double size();
    }
    @Bouncy(999, size=10.0) class Trampoline {}

    A. None
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. Three
    E. Four
    F. Five

    Explanation :
    B. The declaration of Colors and Bouncy compile without issue. 
    The declaration of Trampoline does not compile, though. The Bouncy annotation has two required elements, value() and size(), 
    so the name of the element value cannot be dropped. For this reason, option B is correct.

29. Fill in the blanks: The __________ annotation allows annotations from a superclass to be applied to a subclass, while the __________ annotation 
    determines whether annotations are present in generated Javadoc. (Choose two.)

    A. @Retention in the first blank
    B. @Inherited in the first blank
    C. @Subclass in the first blank
    D. @Javadoc in the second blank
    E. @Retention in the second blank
    F. @Documented in the second blank

    Explanation :
    B,F. The @Inherited annotation determines whether annotations applied to a supertype are applied to its subtypes, 
    while the @Documented annotation allows annotations to be included in generated Javadoc. For these reasons, options B and F are correct.

30. Fill in the blank with the correct annotation usage that allows the code to compile without any warnings.
    @Deprecated(since="5.0")
    public class ProjectPlanner<T> {
        ProjectPlanner create(T t) { return this; }
    }
    @SuppressWarnings(___________________)
    class SystemPlanner {
        ProjectPlanner planner = new ProjectPlanner().create("TPS");
    }

    A. value=ignoreAll
    B. value="deprecation","unchecked"
    C. "unchecked","deprecation"
    D. {"deprecation","unchecked"}
    E. "deprecation"
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    D. The SystemPlanner class compiles although it contains two warnings. 
    First, the ProjectPlanner class is used, which is deprecated. 
    Second, the create() method uses an unchecked/unsafe operation taking a String for the generic type. 
    For this reason, both unchecked and deprecation options are required for the code to compile without any warnings. 
    Option D uses the correct format for passing an array to an annotation. Note that ignoreAll is not a known parameter that the JVM accepts
