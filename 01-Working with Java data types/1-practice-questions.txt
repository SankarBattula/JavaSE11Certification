1. Which of the following are not valid variable names? (Choose two.)
    A. _
    B. _blue
    C. 2blue
    D. blue$
    E. Blue

    Explanation :
    A,C. An identifier name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or underscore (_). 
    Numbers are permitted only for subsequent characters. Therefore, option C is not a valid variable name. 
    Additionally, an identifier may not be a single underscore, making option A an invalid variable name.

2. What is the value of tip after executing the following code snippet?
    int meal = 5;
    int tip = 2;
    var total = meal + (meal>6 ? tip++ : tip--);
    A. 1
    B. 2
    C. 3
    D. 7
    E. None of the above

    Explanation :
    A. In a ternary expression, only one of the two right-most expressions is evaluated. Since meal>6 is false, tip-- is evaluated, and tip++ is skipped. 
    The result is that tip is changed from 2 to 1, making option A the correct answer. 
    The value of total is 7, since the post-decrement operator was used on tip, although you did not need to know this to solve the question.

3. Which is equivalent to var q = 4.0f;?

    A. float q = 4.0f;
    B. Float q = 4.0f;
    C. double q = 4.0f;
    D. Double q = 4.0f;
    E. Object q = 4.0f;

    Explanation :
    A. The f in 4.0f means the type is a float, making option A correct. 
    Local variable type inference chooses an exact match rather than using autoboxing to choose Float.

4. What is the output of the following?

    12: var b = "12";
    13: b += "3";
    14: b.reverse();
    15: System.out.println(b.toString());
    A. 12
    B. 123
    C. 321
    D. The code does not compile.

    Explanation :
    D. Trick question. There is no reverse method on the String class. There is one on the StringBuilder class. 
    Therefore, the code does not compile, and option D is correct.

5. What is the output of the following?

    5: var line = new StringBuilder("-");
    6: var anotherLine = line.append("-");
    7: System.out.print(line == anotherLine);
    8: System.out.print(" ");
    9: System.out.print(line.length());

    A. false 1
    B. false 2
    C. true 1
    D. true 2
    E. It does not compile.

    Explanation :
    D. A StringBuilder is mutable, so the length is 2 after line 6 completes. The 
    StringBuilder methods return a reference to the same object, so you can chain method 
    calls. Therefore, line and anotherLine refer to the same object. This means that line 7 
    prints true. Then on line 9, both references point to the same object of length 2, and option 
    D is correct.

6. Given the following Venn diagram and the boolean variables, apples, oranges, and
    bananas, which expression most closely represents the filled-in region of the diagram?

    apples          oranges

            bananas
    
    A. apples && oranges && !bananas
    B. orange || (oranges && !bananas)
    C. (apples || bananas) && oranges
    D. oranges && apples
    E. (apples || oranges) && !bananas
    F. apples ^ oranges

    Explanation :

    E. The diagram represents all cases where apples or oranges is true, but bananas is false, making option E correct. 
    Option A is close but is correct only if the top overlapping portion of apples and oranges was filled in. 
    For fun, you should try to draw the diagrams that would represent the other answers

7. What is the output of the following?

    5: var line = new String("-");
    6: var anotherLine = line.concat("-");
    7: System.out.print(line == anotherLine);
    8: System.out.print(" ");
    9: System.out.print(line.length());

    A. false 1
    B. false 2
    C. true 1
    D. true 2
    E. Does not compile

    Explanation :
    A. A String is immutable, so a different object is returned on line 6. The object anotherLine points to is of length 2 after line 6 completes. 
    However, the original line reference still points to an object of length 1. Therefore, option A is correct.

8. Which can fill in the blank? (Choose two.)

    public void math() {
    _____ pi = 3.14;
    }

    A. byte
    B. double
    C. float
    D. short
    E. var

    Explanation :
    B,E. Options A and D are incorrect because byte and short do not store values with decimal points. 
    Option C is tempting. However, 3.14 is automatically a double. It requires casting to float or writing 3.14f to be assigned to a float. Therefore, option B is correct. 
    Additionally, option E is correct because local variable type inference is able to automatically determine the type is double.

9. Fill in the blanks: The operators !=, _______, _______, _______, and ++ are listed in the same
    or increasing level of operator precedence. (Choose two.)

    A. ==, *, !
    B. /, %, *
    C. *, --, /
    D. !, *, %
    E. +=, &&, *
    F. *, <, /

    Explanation :
    A,B. Option A is correct and lists the operators in the same or increasing level of operator precedence. 
    In option B, the three operators actually have the same operator precedence, so it is correct. 
    Option C is incorrect, as division (/) has a lower precedence than the decrement operator (--). 
    Option D is incorrect because the logical complement operator (!) has a higher order of precedence than the other two operators. 
    Option E lists the operators in the correct order, but they don’t fit within not equals (!=) and the increment operator (++) as listed in the question. 
    In particular, compound addition operator (+=) and short-circuit logical operator (&&) have a lower precedence than the not equals operator (!=). 
    Finally, option F is incorrect because the relational operator (<) does not fit between multiplication operator (*) and the division operator (/) in order of precedence.

10. How many of these compile?

    18: Comparator<String> c1 = (j, k) -> 0;
    19: Comparator<String> c2 = (String j, String k) -> 0;
    20: Comparator<String> c3 = (var j, String k) -> 0;
    21: Comparator<String> c4 = (var j, k) -> 0;
    22: Comparator<String> c5 = (var j, var k) -> 0;

    A. 0
    B. 1
    C. 2
    D. 3
    E. 4
    F. 5

    Explanation :
    D. Line 18 compiles because neither type is specified for the lambda parameters. Lines 19 and 22 compile because the lambda parameters use a type or var consistently. 
    These are the three lines that compile, making option D correct. 
    Lines 20 and 21 do not compile because var must be used for all parameters in a lambda if it is used for any.

11. The author of this method forgot to include the data type. Which of the following reference
    types can best fill in the blank to complete this method?
    public static void secret(___________ mystery) {
        char ch = mystery.charAt(3);
        mystery = mystery.insert(1, "more");
        int num = mystery.length();
    }

    A. String
    B. StringBuilder
    C. Both
    D. Neither

    Explanation :
    B. The charAt() and length() methods are declared on both String and StringBuilder. 
    However, the insert() method is declared only on a StringBuilder and not a String. 
    Therefore, option B is correct.

12. What is the output of the following?

    var teams = new StringBuilder("333");
    teams.append(" 806");
    teams.append(" 1601");
    System.out.print(teams);

    A. 333
    B. 333 806 1601
    C. The code compiles but outputs something else.
    D. The code does not compile.

    Explanation :
    B. Since StringBuilder is mutable, each call to append adds to the value. When calling print, toString() is automatically called, and 333 806 1601 is output. 
    Therefore, option B is correct.

13. Which of the following declarations does not compile?

    A. double num1, int num2 = 0;
    B. int num1, num2;
    C. int num1, num2 = 0;
    D. int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
    E. All of the above
    F. None of the above

    Explanation :
    A. Option A does not compile because Java does not allow declaring different types as part of the same declaration. 
    The other three options show various legal combinations of combining multiple variables in the same declarations with optional default values.

14. Given the file Magnet.java shown, which of the marked lines can you independently insert
    the line var color; into and still have the code compile?
    // line a1
    public class Magnet {
        // line a2
        public void attach() {
            // line a3
        }
        // line a4
    }

    A. a2
    B. a3
    C. a2 and a3
    D. a1, a2, a3, and a4
    E. None of the above

    Explanation :
    E. Local variable type inference requires a value, so that the type can be inferred. The statement var color; without a value is not allowed, making option E the answer.

15. Which is one of the lines output by this code?

    10: var list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    11: list.add(10);
    12: list.add(9);
    13: list.add(8);
    14:
    15: var num = 9;
    16: list.removeIf(x -> {int keep = num; return x != keep;});
    17: System.out.println(list);
    18:
    19: list.removeIf(x -> {int keep = num; return x == keep;});
    20: System.out.println(list);

    A. []
    B. [8, 10]
    C. [8, 9, 10]
    D. [10, 8]
    E. The code does not compile.

    Explanation :
    A. The code starts by creating a list of three elements. On line 16, it removes two elements and then removes the final one on line 19. 
    This prints an empty list, making option A the correct answer. Note that num is effectively final, so can be used in a lambda.

16. Which of the following can fill in the blank so the code prints true?
    var happy = " :) - (: ";
    var really = happy.trim();
    var question = _____________________;
    System.out.println(really.equals(question));

    A. happy.substring(0, happy.length() - 1)
    B. happy.substring(0, happy.length())
    C. happy.substring(1, happy.length() - 1)
    D. happy.substring(1, happy.length())

    Explanation :
    C. The trim() method returns a String with all leading and trailing white space removed. 
    In this question, that’s the seven-character String: ":) - (:". 
    Options A and B are incorrect because they do not remove the first blank space in happy. 
    Option D is incorrect because it does not remove the last character in happy. Therefore, option C is correct

17. How many of the following lines contain a compiler error?

    double num1 = 2.718;
    double num2 = 2._718;
    double num3 = 2.7_1_8;
    double num4 = _2.718;

    A. 0
    B. 1
    C. 2
    D. 3
    E. 4

    Explanation :
    C. Underscores are allowed between any two digits in a numeric literal, causing num4 to fail to compile. 
    Additionally, underscores are not allowed adjacent to a decimal point, causing a compiler error in num2. 
    Since two lines have errors, option C is the correct answer.

18. What is the output of the following application?

    public class Airplane {
        static int start = 2;
        final int end;
        public Airplane(int x) {
            x = 4;
            end = x;
        }
        public void fly(int distance) {
            System.out.print(end-start+" ");
            System.out.print(distance);
        }
        public static void main(String... start) {
            new Airplane(10).fly(5);
        }
    }

    A. 2 5
    B. 8 5
    C. 6 5
    D. The code does not compile.
    E. None of the above.

    Explanation :
    A. The code compiles, so option D is incorrect. The input to the constructor is ignored, making the assignment of end to be 4. 
    Since start is 2, the subtraction of 4 by 2 results in the application printing 2, followed by 5, making option A the correct answer.

19. What is the output of the following class?

    1: package rocket;
    2: public class Countdown {
    3:      public static void main(String[] args) {
    4:          var builder = "54321";
    5:          builder = builder.substring(4);
    6:          System.out.println(builder.charAt(2));
    7:      }
    8: }

    A. 2
    B. 3
    C. 4
    D. None of the above

    Explanation :
    D. Line 4 creates a String of length 5. Since String is immutable, line 5 creates a new String with the value 1 and assigns it to builder. 
    Remember that indexes in Java begin with zero, so the substring() method is taking the values from the fifth element through the end. 
    Since the first element is the last element, there’s only one character in there. Then line 6 tries to retrieve the second indexed element. 
    Since there is only one element, this gives a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, and option D is correct.

20. What is the output of the following application?
    package transporter;
    public class Rematerialize {
        public static void main(String[] input) {
            int init = 11;
            int split = 3;
            int partA = init / split;
            int partB = init % split;
            int result = split * (partB + partA);
            System.out.print(result);
        }
    }

    A. 9
    B. 11
    C. 12
    D. 15
    E. The code does not compile.
    F. None of the above.

    Explanation :
    D. The code compiles and runs without issue, making option E incorrect. In this example, partA is the integer division of the two numbers. 
    Since 3 does not divide 11 evenly, it is rounded down to 3. The variable partB is the remainder from the first expression, which is 2. 
    The results are added together, resulting in the expression 3 * 5, or 15, and making option D correct.

21. What is the result of the following code?
    var sb = new StringBuilder("radical")
    .insert(sb.length(), "robots");
    System.out.println(sb);

    A. radicarobots
    B. radicalrobots
    C. The code does not compile.
    D. The code compiles but throws an exception at runtime.

    Explanation :
    C. Calling the constructor and then insert() is an example of method chaining. However, the sb.length() call is a problem. 
    The sb reference doesn’t exist until after the chained calls complete. 
    Just because it happens to be on a separate line doesn’t change when the reference is created. Since the code does not compile, option C is correct.

22. Given the following code snippet, what is the value of dinner after it is executed?
    int time = 9;
    int day = 3;
    var dinner = ++time >= 10 ? day-- <= 2
    ? "Takeout" : "Salad" : "Leftovers";

    A. Takeout
    B. Leftovers
    C. Salad
    D. The code does not compile but would compile if parentheses were added.
    E. None of the above.

    Explanation :
    C. While parentheses are recommended for ternary operations, especially embedded ones, they are not required, so option D is incorrect. 
    The first expression evaluates to 10 >= 10, so the first branch of the ternary operation is selected, and "Leftovers" can be eliminated. 
    The expression in the second ternary operation evaluates to 3 <= 2, which is false, so "Salad" is selected, and option C is correct.

23. What is the output of the following?
    var teams = new String("694");
    teams.concat(" 1155");
    teams.concat(" 2265");
    teams.concat(" 2869");
    System.out.println(teams);

    A. 694
    B. 694 1155 2265 2869
    C. The code compiles but outputs something else.
    D. The code does not compile.

    Explanation :
    A. Since String is immutable, each call to concat() returns a new object with the new value. 
    However, that return value is ignored, and the teams variable never changes in value. 
    Therefore, it stays as 694, and option A is correct.

24. How many of the following lines compile?
    bool b = null;
    Bool bl = null;
    int i = null;
    Integer in = null;
    String s = null;

    A. None
    B. One
    C. Two
    D. Three
    E. Four
    F. Five

    Explanation 
    C. First, bool and Bool are not valid Java types. They should be boolean and Boolean, respectively. Next, objects are allowed to have a null reference while primitives cannot. 
    Since Integer and String are objects, those lines compile. Finally, the line with int is a primitive, so assigning null to it does not compile. Therefore, option C is correct.

25. What is the output of the following code snippet?
    int height = 2, length = 3;
    boolean w = height > 1 | --length < 4;
    var x = height!=2 ? length++ : height;
    boolean z = height % length == 0;
    System.out.println(w + "-" + x + "-" + z);

    A. true-2-true
    B. false-2-false
    C. true-2-false
    D. true-3-false
    E. true-3-true
    F. false-3-false

    Explanation :
    A. In the first expression, height > 1 is true. 
    Since it uses the logical operator (|), which evaluates both sides, the right side is still executed, resulting in length being assigned a value of 2 and w assigned a value of true. 
    In the second expression, only the right-hand side of the expression is evaluated, so x is assigned a value of 2, and length is unchanged. 
    The last expression evaluates to 2 % 2, which is 0, so z is assigned a value of 0.

26. What is the output of the following?
    1: public class Legos {
    2:      public static void main(String[] args) {
    3:          var sb = new StringBuilder();
    4:          sb.append("red");
    5:          sb.deleteCharAt(0);
    6:          sb.delete(1, 2);
    7:          System.out.println(sb);
    8:      }
    9: }

    A. e
    B. d
    C. ed
    D. None of the above

    Explanation :
    A. Line 3 creates an empty StringBuilder. 
    Line 4 adds three characters to it. 
    Line 5 removes the first character, resulting in ed. 
    Line 6 deletes the characters starting at position 1 and ending right before position 2, which removes the character at index 1, which is d. 
    The only character left is e, so option A is correct.

27. Which is a true statement?
    A. If s.contains("abc") is true, then s.equals("abc") is also true.
    B. If s.contains("abc") is true, then s.startsWith("abc") is also true.
    C. If s.startsWith("abc") is true, then s.equals("abc") is also true.
    D. If s.startsWith("abc") is true, then s.contains("abc") is also true.

    Explanation :
    D. Options A and B are not true if the String is "deabc". 
    Option C is not true if the String is "abcde". 
    Option D is true in all cases.

28. What is the output of the following code snippet?
    boolean carrot = true;
    Boolean potato = false;
    var broccoli = true;
    carrot = carrot & potato;
    broccoli = broccoli ? !carrot : potato;
    potato = !broccoli ^ carrot;
    System.out.println(carrot + "," + potato + "," + broccoli);

    A. true,false,true
    B. true,true,true
    C. false,false,false
    D. false,true,true
    E. false,false,true
    F. The code does not compile.

    Explanation :
    E. The code compiles, so option F is incorrect. The first expression evaluates to true & false, which sets carrot to false. 
    The next expression resolves to true ? true : false, which results in broccoli being set to true. 
    The last expression reduces to false ^ false, which sets potato to false. Therefore, option E is the correct output.

29. What does this code output?
    var babies = Arrays.asList("chick", "cygnet", "duckling");
    babies.replaceAll(x -> { var newValue = "baby";
        return newValue; });
    System.out.println(babies);

    A. [baby]
    B. [baby, baby, baby]
    C. [chick, cygnet, duckling]
    D. None of the above.
    E. The code does not compile.

    Explanation :
    B. The code successfully defines a local variable inside the lambda. Each value is replaced with baby. 
    Since we have a List, all three are output, and option B is the correct answer.

30. What is the output of the following class?
    1: package rocket;
    2: public class Countdown {
    3:      public static void main(String[] args) {
    4:          var builder = new StringBuilder("54321");
    5:          builder.substring(2);
    6:          System.out.println(builder.charAt(1));
    7:      }
    8: }

    A. 1
    B. 2
    C. 3
    D. 4
    E. Does not compile

    Explanation :
    D. Line 4 creates a StringBuilder of length 5. Pay attention to the substring() method in StringBuilder. It returns a String with the value 321. 
    It does not change the StringBuilder itself. Then line 6 retrieves the second indexed element from that unchanged value, which is 4. 
    Therefore, option D is correct.
