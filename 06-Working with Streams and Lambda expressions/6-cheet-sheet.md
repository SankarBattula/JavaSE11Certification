



There are five basic functional interfaces that, by default, operate on a single reference type: Predicate, Unary Operator, Function, Supplier, Consumer and one which operates on two reference types â€” BinaryOperator

Each of the six basic types has three variants that accept a primitive: double, int, or long

Variants of the three basic types accept two arguments: BiPredicate, BiFunction, BiConsumer

Function has 6 variants that convert one of the primitives (double, int, long) to a different primitive.

Function and BiFunction each have 3 variants that take a reference type and return a primitive double, int, or long

Supplier has a variant that returns a boolean

BiConsumer has three variants that accept a reference type and a primitive: double, int, or long

****Basic Types:****

PREDICATE              |	takes one (or two) argument(s) and returns a boolean (5 variants)

UNARY OPERATOR         |	result and the single argument types are the same (4 variants)

BINARY OPERATOR        |	result and both argument types are the same (4 variants)

FUNCTION               |	result and one (or two) argument(s) types are different (17 variants)

SUPPLIER               |	takes no arguments, returns a value ( 5 variants )

CONSUMER               |	takes one (or two) arguments and returns no value (8 variants)
