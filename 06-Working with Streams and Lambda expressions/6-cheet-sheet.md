Each of the six basic types has three variants that accept a primitive: double, int, or long

Variants of the three basic types accept two arguments: BiPredicate, BiFunction, BiConsumer

Function has 6 variants that convert one of the primitives (double, int, long) to a different primitive.

Function and BiFunction each have 3 variants that take a reference type and return a primitive double, int, or long

Supplier has a variant that returns a boolean

BiConsumer has three variants that accept a reference type and a primitive: double, int, or long
